# Introduction

**Recall** is an extension of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code to help you remember stuff using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

It creates flashcards directly from your notes and let's you test yourself repeatedly to maximize your memeory retention. This can be usefull when learning a new language, taking a course on a particular subject, remembering jokes or pretty much anything else you want to remember. The choice is yours ðŸ˜‰

# How does it work?

Write your notes in Markdown and store them in .md files. For more information on Markdown, please visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
**Recall** will scan your workspace folders, identify possible "flashcards" and test you using spaced repetition.

Note: To see your note rendered as HTML, simply use the Markdown Preview functionality of VS Code.

## How are flashcards identified

**Recall** scans all the .md files in you workspace and identifies flashcards using the following algorithm

- at header level
  - any header marks a start of a new flashcard
  - any blank line marks a start of a new page (of that flashcard)
- at bullet point level (when enabled)
  - any first level bullet point with of the configured type is a start of a new card
  - the bullet point is split using the line divider string (e.g. ::), configurable
  - the newline at the end of the bullet point also serves as a page divider
- if a flashcard has at least two pages, it will be put in the testing queue

To better understand the above, look at the practical examples in the [demo folder]().

## Testing yourself

To really train your memory, you should do a daily review of your cards. To run it, simply run the "Recall: Flashcards Test" command in VSCode
(easiest way is to press `Ctrl-P` to see list of commands and start typing the name).

A webview will appear show you the first page of the first card to review. You then have the following options/hotkeys:

- `Space` - expands the card and shows one more page (repeat until the card is fully expanded)
- `Enter` - mark the card as remembered
- `F` - mark the card as forgotten
- `N` - go to the next card without logging any result
- `A` - archive card - card won't show for review anymore

## **Recall** level

Every card has a so called "recall level" which indicates how well you remember it. It also represents the number of days after which it
will be queued for review again.

All cards start with a default recall level of 1 which means the card will be queued for review the next day. If you mark it as remembered,
the recall level will be doubled. If you mark it as forgotten, the recall level will be halved.

# Configuration

You can find the configuration options in Settings (Extensions -> **Recall**). The two most important settings are

- Default Level - defines at which level to detect flashcards
  - **ignore** - no detection will be done
  - **header** - any header starts a new card
  - **bullet** - any "-" bullet starts a new card (as well as a header)
  - **asterisk** - any "*" bullet starts a new card (as well as a header)
- Line Divider - delimiter used in single line cards (use any string that works for you - colon, semicolon, slash, etc.), can even be multi-character sequence

If you need to override the default level of card recognition for a particular file, you can use the YAML header.
For example, to tell **Recall** that individual bullets should be recognized in the file, simply add the following sequence at the beginning of your .md file.

```yaml
---
recall: bullet
---
```
