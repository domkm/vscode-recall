# Headers still work

This is the first paragraph. It will still become the second page of the card
(first one is the header itself).

This is the second paragraph. It is separated from the first one by an empty line.
It will become the third page of the card.

# Dash bullets are their own cards

This is an explanatory text. It will become page two of the card marked by the header above.

* These are "asterisk" bullets.
* They will not be considered separate cards
* This list will therefore be page three of the card

- These are "dash" bullets, every dash starts a new card.
- The first two bullets don't contain a line divider (colon) and will therefore be ignored.
- If you want to create a card: You need to put line divider on it. Everything behind it becomes the second page of the card.
  - ... and everything after the first newline
  - ... will become the third page
- You can use this for
  - term definitions
  - language vocabulary
  - etc.
- Term: This is the definition
